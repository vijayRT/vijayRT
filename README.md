### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Vijay. I'm a software engineer with `new Date().getFullYear() - 2017` years of experience.

I love writing clean, modular, code that follows functional programming paradigms.

I primarily build APIs and websites using Typescript. I have significant experience with Vue 2 and 3, Nuxt, React, and Next.js.
